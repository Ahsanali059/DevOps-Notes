=> Application is nothing but collection of programs

=> Every Application contains 3 layers 

1) Frontend 
2) Backend 
3) Database 

-> Life without Docker
=> In Realtime , our application will be deployed into multiple 
Enviroments for Testing Purpose 

1) Dev Enviroment --->Developer Testing
2) QA Enviroment  ---> Testing Team Testing
3) Prod Enviroment ---> Production Testing
4) UAT Enviroment ---> User Acceptance Testing/Client side testing
5) PILOT Enviroment(Pre-Production Enviroment) --> Testing with live Database

=> When Testing is completed in all above Enviroments 
then it will deployed into Production Enviroment
=> Production Enviroment is nothing but live server
=> End users will access the application through browser

============================================================
Life without Docker
------------------------------------------------------------
=> we need to install required software in each environment
to run our application
=> we need to make sure we are using same versions of software 
in all machines.
=> If any software is mismtach then our application execution is 
failed.

================
Life with Docker
================

=> Docker is a containerization platform 
=> Docker is used to build and deploy application into any machine without 
bothering about software installation/ and dependencies.

=> Dependencies means which are required to run our application
     Dependencies = OS / Angular / Node / Java / Maven / Tomcat / MySQL / MongoDB
     => These are the dependencies required to run our application
=> we provide all thses application dependencies in a single file called as 
Docker file.

=> Docker will reduce the gap between Development and 
Production Enviroments

===================
Docker Architecture
===================

1) DokcerFile: It Contains instruction to build docker image
2) Docker Image: It is a package which contains code + dependencies.
3) Docker registry: It is a repository where docker images 
are stored.
4) Docker container: It is a running instance of 
docker image.

Note: Once Docker Image is created then we can run 
it multiple times
