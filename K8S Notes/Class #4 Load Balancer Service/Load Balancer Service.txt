=====================
Load Balancer Service
=====================

-> It is one type of K8S Service.

-> It is used to expose our pods outside cluster using load Balancer

-> When we use Load Balancer as service type then one Load Balancer will be created 
in AWS Cloud.

-> Using Load Balancer URL we can access our application.

-> Load Balancer will distribute the traffic to multiple worker node nodes
in Round Robbin fashion.

====================
Problem in Node Port
====================

-> When we are using Node Port all traffic load into one worker Node traffic 
is not distributed

Note: Load Balancer is outside our cluster

=============
POD Lifecycle
=============

-> POD is a smallest building block that we can run in K8S cluster.

-> We are using kubectl to send request to control plane to create POD

-> API Server receive our request and will store request details in ETCD.

-> Schedular will find un-scheduled PODS and it will schedule in worker nodes.

-> Node Agent (kubelet) will see POD schedule and it will fire Docker Engine.

-> Docker engine will run our containers.

Note: PODS are emphemeral (Short lived Objects)
