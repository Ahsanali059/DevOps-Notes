==============
K8S Namespaces 
==============

-> Namespaces are equal to packages in the Java.
-> Namespaces are used to grouped our K8S Components.
-> We can create multiple namespaces in k8s cluster.
   ex: spring-web-app-ns,spring-web-app-db-ns 

-> Namespaces are logically isolated with each other.
Note: when we delete namespace all the components created under that namespace will be deleted.
